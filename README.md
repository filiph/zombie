# Zombie! In Dart!

This demo 'game' was implemented during my [GDG DevFest Prague 2013](http://www.devfest.cz/ "DevFest Praha 2013")
talk titled **Dart v1.0**.

None of this should be considered best practice or even good code, of course. This
was designed solely to show some of the interesting properties of Dart as a web
app/game development platform.
